### Why?
This timeline was inspired by the ones made availible on the Royal British Columbia Museum's learning portal. My ulitimate wish for this project is to create different perspectives about the not so distant past of Victoria. As someone who grew up here, I have been exposed to all of the cultures that have influenced the city, thanks in large part to the Royal BC Museum. The planning that went into this timeline consisted of thinking about the city, and how it may be viewed from an outsiders perspective. I decided to add the vintage postcard as a back ground image for each slide to represent the erasure of both First Nation and Chinese history of Victoria, with overlapping photographs depicting the Songhees reserve in both the inner harbour and Esquimalt, illustrations depicting the view of Fort Victoria from the previous reserve in the inner harbour and vice versa, and several depicting the early architecture and people living in Victoria's Chinatown. I have also included a document that indicates a Chinese immigrant had payed his head tax upon entering the Dominion of Canada. I think that blatant displays of cultural genocide and xenophobia juxtapose with the backgroung image well. 

Another aspect that I would like to point out is something I discovered while I was collecting additional data for the project. Both the City of Victoria and the City of Esquimalt list a detailed history of each municipality, but each fail to mention the policies and social contructions that have shaped the face of the city, such as when the Songhees were forced off of their land, and the exclusionary policies that enabled discrimination against both the Chinese and First Nation inhabitants of Victoria. The disinfrancisment of both First Nation and Chinese people in both provincial and municipal elections should be known.
